# MagicalMusicalStaircase
Using Python, a Raspberry Pi, lasers, and photocells, any staircase can be turned into a musical staircase.
When the photocell senses an abrupt change in light, the RPi plays a note specific to that step.
The staircase is not sensitive to changes in ambient light as a expodential filter is used to find the threshold to play the note.

This project was made for Senior Project English @ ABRHS in 2017. Our purpose was to "spontaneously spread joy into people's lives" and we installed it in the school for a day. This guide is meant to shed more light on how we did it and serve as a tutorial for future projects.
